<h1>Tomisin Ogbebor</h1>
<p>I am learning to code because I want to become proficient at it. I am wanting to go into 
Fintech as my final goal and I do think it is important. Right now I am in my first year of computer science.
I donâ€™t know anything about coding but I would love to learn a lot. I have a beginner module on the basics of coding and I do want to get at least 70%.</p>
